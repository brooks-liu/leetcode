Notes doc, for all things I find interesting/important about solutions and problems!

Linked Lists:
    While using linked lists, you can often create one head and a current linked list, and instead of putting in a value into a list,
    you can just point your curr to the node of the already created list, and continue like that. At the end, you can return head.next to 
    get the actual start of the list (like problem 21 solution).
    


General:
    Go through simple examples!
    Don't get scared of time complexity, make a solution and improve on it.
